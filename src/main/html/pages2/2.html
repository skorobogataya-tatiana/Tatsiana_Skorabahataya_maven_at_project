    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
    Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through
    the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant!
    Todayâ€™s user expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable
    to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones.

    HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display
    on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images. HyperText Markup
    Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. The language, which has code words and syntax
    just like any other language, is relatively easy to comprehend and, as time goes on, increasingly powerful in what
    it allows someone to create.

    HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text called hyperlinks,
    users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet
    simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they mark it as
    a specific type of text.
